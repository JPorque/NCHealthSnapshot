# NCHealthSnapshot - ENGL105 Unit 3 Project
A look into low birthweight in the counties of NC.

This repository contains my project for the third unit of the ENGL105 course at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

It consists of three python notebooks, which provide a basic introduction into python and the filtering of data, as well as a raw data and filtered data file.

The introductory material in this repository comes from material from the [Research Hub](#https://library.unc.edu/data/) of UNC's Davis Library.

## Purpose

The raw data of this repository, County-Health-Data.csv, describes "Health Data" for counties in the United States. It is additionally organized by State and Region, and its contents thoroughly cover many health related issues and data that can be used to draw conclusions about the comparative health of different areas of the U.S.

This data was provided/suggested by Steven Gotzler, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, as an excellent data set that was in need of further specificity.

This data was filtered using instructional information from the two "Pandas" files, also provided by Dr. Gotzler. The file "Feeder 3.1" describes the process used to create the final subset of filtered data. This final subset was then imported into Microsoft Excel, where it was further simplified into more usable data by averaging the two values for each county into one.

The filtered data removes extraneous information and highlights simply the low birthweight in the 100 counties of North Carolina. "Low birthweight" is defined to be under 5.5 pounds by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The purpose of this is to dive deeper into the percentages of underweight births in NC counties, potentially showing that these percentages exceed the national average of 8.24% (taken from CDC data).

This repository was created so that others might be aware of health issues that are more or less prevalent in their state than nationally. Others are encouraged to follow the instructional and example files within this repository to look at specific issues that they think their state or county might have.

## Contents

The repository is organized by seperating the Pandas introduction files into their own folder, Pandas intro, and the filtered data, visualization, and file detailing the filtering process in their own folder, Final Product and Instructions. The raw data set remains easily accessible without a folder.

Below is a map of North Carolina with the low birthweight data displayed next to each county marker. The points on the map are also color coded to show the differences between counties at a glance. The full interactive map is available below the screenshot.
